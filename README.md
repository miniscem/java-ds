# Java Data Structures Playground

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This is my personal playground for implementing both basic and advanced data structures in Java. I'm building this project as a way to explore, and have some fun with classic (and maybe not-so-classic) data structures.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Classic & Advanced Data Structures:** Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, and more.
- **Java Implementations:** All code is written from scratch in Java, with a focus on clarity and learning rather than pure performance.
- **Unit Tests:** Each structure comes with tests to make sure things actually work (and to help me catch bugs as I go).

## Why This Exists

I'm doing this as a side project to deepen my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and Java itself. It's a hands-on way to:

- Reinforce computer science fundamentals
- Practice writing clean, idiomatic Java
- Explore edge cases and real-world usage

## How It's Organized

- `src/main/java/me/markminisce/app/basicdatastructures/` â€” All the data structure implementations
- `src/test/java/me/markminisce/app/basicdatastructures/` â€” JUnit tests for each structure
- `pom.xml` â€” Maven build file

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/miniscem/java-ds.git
   ```
2. **Build with Maven:**
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. **Run the tests:**
   ```sh
   mvn test
   ```

## Contributions

This is mostly for my own learning, but if you spot a bug or want to suggest a new structure, feel free to open an issue or PR!
